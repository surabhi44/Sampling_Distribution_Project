# Sampling_Distribution_Project

1) Create a new repository

2) Add code to call functions which will play the role of tables for z, t, chi-square and F distributions, namely, for z, write a code segment that will take (a) z0 as input and give P(z<z0) as output; (b) alpha as input and give z0 as output where P(z<z0)=alpha. Same for the rest, except it will take degree(s) of freedom (dof) also as input.
